## 📋 Copy the Example Code

Copy the prompt from the example so you can use it to generate code.

### Instructions

1. **Click the "Copy Prompt" button**: In the example view, click the **"Copy Prompt"** button. The button will show **"✓ Copied!"** to confirm the prompt is in your clipboard.

2. **Confirm the prompt is copied**: The exact prompt text is now ready to paste into GitHub Copilot Chat or use with AI First Book Examples.

3. **Open a new editor** (optional): Press `Ctrl+N` (or `Cmd+N` on Mac) to open a new editor tab if you want a clean workspace. You'll paste the prompt into the chat interface, not directly into the editor.

**Note:** You're copying a **prompt** (the question/instruction), not the code itself. You'll use this prompt in the next step to generate code using GitHub Copilot Chat or AI First Book Examples.
