## 🎓 Learning by Comparison

### Why compare different solutions?

- **Multiple approaches**: There's often more than one way to solve a problem
- **Best practices**: Learn different coding styles and techniques
- **Understanding**: See how the same prompt can yield different results
- **Flexibility**: Adapt solutions to your specific use case

### Learning Workflows:
